# datorama-d3-data-bars-table
Custom widget for Datorama.
Creates an Excel-like Data Bars Table.

This works just like a pivot table, except bars are added inside each cell to show a visual representation of the data, scaled within the column's data range. This combines the exactness of tables with the clarity of bar charts to let you easily identify rows and columns of most interest.

Subtotals currently aren't possible, since that data is not included in the widget query response.
